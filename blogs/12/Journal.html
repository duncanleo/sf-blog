            <h2>Calabash</h2>

            <p>This week I worked on Calabash. It‚Äôs the UI automation framework that works on Android and iOS. I mainly work on the Android side of the code.</p>

            <h3>Undocumented behaviour</h3>

            <p>One of the functionality that we needed in Calabash was the ability to pass data to the app being automated at runtime. This is so we can change certain functionality in the app for a particular test, such as setting a staging environment
                URL. As such, the app would also need to be coded to handle such data being passed in and modify its own behaviour accordingly.</p>

            <p>While this functionality is already there for iOS, it was sorely missing from the Android side of Calabash. After talking to one of our Android developers, Akshay, I discovered that Android could take in such data using the Intents system,
                and I set out to find a way to inject them to Calabash‚Äôs launch Intent. After poring through the code, and even forking the Calabash-Android repository once, I discovered that the groundwork was already laid for this functionality, but
                it was not documented in any form anywhere. There weren‚Äôt even forum or StackOverflow posts on the matter. Since I had found it, I filed an issue on their GitHub, and filed a card for the Android app to add functionality to handle such
                runtime data parameters.</p>

            <h1>WWDC</h1>

            <p>It‚Äôs dub dub week, and Jurvis is attending it as a scholarship recipient.</p>

            <p>This year, Apple renamed OS X to macOS, released a Siri SDK, and made watchOS faster. They also released a new file system to replace the aging HFS+. Awesome üçé</p>

            <h1>Saturday</h1>

            <p>Over a month ago our UT supervisor showed us a video on how to make prata, and I was crazy enough to try it.</p>

            <p><img src='photos/9297a94f7c66dd8d060ef7410ac14ac9.jpeg'></p>

            <p>It turned out pretty well. It looks and tastes like prata. It‚Äôs just a bit too thick though, but it‚Äôs amazing for my first attempt at anything like it üòÅ</p>
