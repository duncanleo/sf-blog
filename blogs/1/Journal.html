            <h1>Weekly Log #1</h1>

            <p>I‚Äôve been in SF for a week, here‚Äôs a little blog post on what‚Äôs gone on so far. The 16-hour flight (with a 1-hour transit at Hong Kong) sounded scary, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm on an internship in San Francisco, along with seven other students from my school.</p>

            <h1>Singapore‚Äôs weather is terrible</h1>

            <p>The weather here is really pleasant, but it gets too cold once the winds start blowing. It‚Äôs always cooler than Singapore though - the summer is forecast to be around 21¬∞C (some of my colleagues think this is quite warm!).</p>

            <h1>Great views by default</h1>

            <p><img src='photos/f51421f2b5704b5d7862154936c5be57.jpeg'></p>

            <p>We‚Äôre staying at this place called Cornerstone Academy. It‚Äôs located in San Francisco City and it‚Äôs got a terrific view of the surrounding houses. (Also, meet my roommate Jurvis!)</p>

            <h1>Muir woods</h1>

            <p>We went to the redwood forest. On the way, there were a lot of great scenery.</p>

            <p>Nice views you won‚Äôt get in Singapore. Seriously, everything looks so good.</p>

            <h1>UserTesting</h1>

            <p><img src='photos/8f924eefabdb6f953d48b0adf0423ff0.jpeg'></p>

            <p>Two of my colleagues at UserTesting, James and Akshay! Everyone‚Äôs really nice and friendly. We haven‚Äôt gone through the official welcoming process called ‚ÄúBoot Camp‚Äù, which will happen next week. We were given some introduction to how the
                Engineering department worked and the tools they used.</p>

            <p>We were also given access to some code repositories, and it was my first time seeing code on the Ruby on Rails framework, which is something I have to learn üòÑ.</p>

            <h1>Dinner with hosts</h1>

            <p><img src='photos/dc8cab5c40f74f8754c90b2d13de9504.jpeg'></p>

            <p>On Wednesday we had dinner with our hosts (Harry and Li Soon) and our teachers (Patrice and Darran) at Red Robin, a restaurant in San Bruno, CA. The serving sizes were quite huge - drinks and fries had complementary refills.</p>

            <p><img src='photos/5bd5bd3d6f672605c8cf925ccccaf045.jpeg'></p>

            <p>Here‚Äôs a shot of everyone - the eight of us, Harry, Li Soon and Darran. Patrice is out of the shot (he took the photo).</p>
