            <h2>Hubot</h2>

            <p>Added some functionality for the Hubot. I was trying to debug the bot by logging JSON payloads to the console, but unfortunately Heroku is structured in such a way where their output is printed asynchronously, meaning that I end up with jumbled-up
                lines of JSON. To work around this, I had the bot post the JSON to a Slack channel. Now the Slack channel is spammed full of JSON 😢</p>

            <h1>Friday - Sunday</h1>

            <p>We went to LA. We had this plan for a couple of weeks now 😄</p>

            <p>Sitting near the sea</p>

            <p>We stayed at an AirBNB. It was almost like a hotel - there was a booklet telling us the house rules and places of interest, and there were towels and toiletries provided. Honestly, it was beyond my expectations. 🏨</p>

            <h2>Farmer’s Market</h2>

            <p>We went to a Farmer’s Market nearby, which is a place for people to sell their goods. There was live music, great food, and shops selling other items.</p>
